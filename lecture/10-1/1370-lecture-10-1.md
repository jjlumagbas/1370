# What we will discuss

- Basic file I/O recipe


# What we _wont_ discuss (in very much detail)

(We'll come back to these soon!)

- local variables and mutation
- classes, constructors, and instance methods
- while loops

# Basic file output recipe:

1. Open a file
2. Write to the file using `<<`
3. Close the file


# Basic file input recipe:

Represents some media of sequential information (text on the console, files, video on the internet)

(In the case of file streams) We can:

- insert characters in sequence, or

# Basic file input recipe:

1. Open a file stream

# `while` loop

1. evaluates the conditional expression
  - if true, goes to 2
  - if false, exit the loop and performs the next line after the closing brace

2. evaluates the body of the loop
3. back to 1

# File output:

_What if the file does not exist?_

_Which types of data can we write to a file?_

_How do we move to the next line when writing to a file?_

# File input:

_What if the file does not exist?_

_What if the file is empty?_

# Structure of the DATA 
# -> 
# Structure of the FUNCTION

---

# Enumeration

- fixed set of values

# Interval

- number ranges

# Atomic

- no conditional behavior

---

## A. Atomic / B. Enumeration / C. Interval 

1. Produce the complement of a given primary color
2. Given a month of the year, return the season
3. Convert a temperature from F to C
4. Classify an image as either small, medium, or large based on its area
5. Guess the season based on the temperature
6. Determine if a ph level is acidic, basic, or neutral
7. Produce an appropriate greeting, given the hour of the day

How do we:
- _write a data definition?_
- _derive the template from the data definition?_

# Enumeration

- fixed set of values

# Interval

- number ranges

# Atomic

- no conditional behavior

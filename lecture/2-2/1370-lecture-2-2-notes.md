Complexity



What's the problem with this? 

Not easy to:
- make changes easily
- Spot errors


Be able to solve more complex problems without the same amount of increase in complexity of code

Complex problems -> simple code

Takeaways:

How easy is it to:

- understand what the code does?
- find any bugs in the code?
- make changes to the code?

- same output, better code (easier to read and understand)
- what makes it easier to read and understand?
- names make intent clearer (why vs what or how),
- names hide detail (allows us to see the bigger picture more easily, allows us to build on previous solutions - can reuse previous code!)
- why is clearer code better? code spends most of its life in maintenance: bug fixes, code changes
- code will always have bugs!
- code will always be changed! requirements will change, business landscape will change requirements



The ratio of time spent reading (code) versus writing is well over 10 to 1 ... (therefore) making it easy to read makes it easier to write.

Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute.

There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.

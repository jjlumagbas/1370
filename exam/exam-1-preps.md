# Exam 1 Study Guide

## What to take to the exam

- Single page (front and back) handwritten cheatsheet
- 2 blank pieces of paper (scrap paper because I won't allow erasures: write your working answers here and then transfer them to the answer sheet.)
- Don't have to take: Scantron. I'll provide the answer sheets.


## What _not_ to study

Don't memorize any of the built-in operations/functions! Here are all that you'll encounter or need in the exam. Feel free to add them to your cheatsheet:

- `image-width`
- `image-height`
- `text`
- `number->string`
- arithmetic operations
- number comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `=`)
- `big-bang`, `to-draw`, `on-tick`, `on-key`


## Review questions

### Basic expressions

- Can you determine whether or not an expression is syntactically correct?
- Can you write a syntactically correct expression?
- Given an expression, can you identify the type of that expression?


### Named constants and function definitions

- Can you determine whether or not a name is syntactically correct?
- Can you write a syntactically correct name?
- Can you identify the different parts of a function definition and function call? (header, name, parameters, body, argument)
- Can you write a function definition, if the input types and expected outputs are specified?


### Conditional expressions

- Can you evaluate a conditional expression to produce a value?
- Can you write a conditional expression with question parts that deal with number ranges?
- Can you write a conditional expression with question parts that deal with checking for equality of a certain value?


### Interactive (big-bang) programs

- Given definitions of event handler functions, and the initial world state value, can you write an appropriate big-bang expression?

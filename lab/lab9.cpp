// Part 1:

/*
A tea shop sells its house blends of tea for $3.50 per tin of loose tea, 
and $4.25 per box of tea bags. The shop never sells partial tins or partial 
boxes of tea. Design a function tea_total that expects the number of 
loose tea tins and the number of tea bag boxes, and 
returns the total amount owed for that sale.
*/

// Part 2:

/*
A bookstore awards points to its customers based on the number of books 
purchased each month. Design the function points which accepts the number 
of books a customer purchased for the month, and returns the number of 
points earned that month.
*/

// Part 3:

/*
A movie theater charges $10.00 for attending shows before 5:00 pm, 
and $14.00 for attending later shows. In addition, the theater offers a 
20% discount for 10 or more tickets purchased. Design get_price that 
expects a string representing a showing type ("early" or "reg"), and 
the number of tickets purchased, and returns the total price for 
attending that showing type for those number of tickets. 
If any other showing type string is given, it returns 0.0.

; Part 1: Below this function definition, write 3 function calls
; that each produce a different result. Then, write a 4th function
; call that produces this error: "cond: all question results were false"
; (Comment out that 4th function call before proceeding)

; BONUS: Step through each of the function calls by clicking
; Step above instead of Run. Narrate each step of the
; evaluation to your partner.

(define (greet-period h)
  (cond
    [(<= 1 h 11) "Good Morning!"]
    [(<= 12 h 17) "Good Afternoon!"]
    [(<= 18 h 24) "Good Evening!"]))


; Part 2: Fill in the blanks from a given set of
; question and answer parts
(define (ph p)
  (cond
    [... ...]
    [... ...]

; Part 3: convert-c-to accepts a temperature in Celsius and
; converts to either Fahrenheit or Kelvin depending on the
; given unit ("f" or "k"). If the given unit is neither "f"
; nor "k", just return the temperature in Celsius.

; Fill in the answer parts in the cond expression.

; Celsius to Fahrenheit: (C Ã— 9/5) + 32 = F
; Celsius to Kelvin: C + 273.15 = K

(define (convert-c-to unit temp)
  (cond
    [(string=? unit "f") ...]
    [(string=? unit "k") ...]
    [else ...]))




; Part 4: letter-grade accepts a students number grade and
; produces the equivalent letter grade. Fill in the question
; parts in the cond expression.

; Refer to: https://github.com/jjlumagbas/1370#grading

Lyrics to "Friday I'm in Love" by The Cure:

It's Friday I'm in love
Saturday wait
And Sunday always comes too late

I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday 
We chilled on Sunday

Design the following functions, following the design recipe:

0. Read problem statement, write wishlist
1. Data definitions
2. Signature, purpose, stub
3. Examples
4. Template
5. Function body
6. Test and debug

Note 1: Keep the following in your submission, labelled and commented out:

- Stub
- Template

Note 2: To get full points, include a full set of examples (tests) to
prove that the function works correctly for any possible (valid) inputs

Note 3: Have 1 person do Part 1, then hand over keyboard/mouse to the
 second person for Part 2

; Part 1: Design the function bump-up, which accepts a letter grade
; and returns the next highest letter grade

;    color of visible light, given the measure of the wavelength.
;    The square should be solid and be 60 pixels on one side
